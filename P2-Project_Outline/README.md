## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This project is an app which lets users choose wall/furniture colors for a particular room.
User is given a palette of colors(the company's catalog). He gets to select a room, and then the wall paint shade he would like to test to check how it looks. This should give him the chance to try out different shades before zeroing in on one and buying the same.

Also there will be the option for a user to create his own shade out of the hues we offer. I personally have done this in Home Depot, when we got small sample tins of different catalog paints and then mixed them in a particular ratio to get the exact paint shade we wanted on our wall. This way user gets a customized product, and if the particular shade gets a good rating in our quarterly magazine publications, we will have it up in our "customers' creations" database/section of the catalog.

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts, and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
Search/Sort: Search or sort  colors under a particular price range/a color family/seasonal sale offer, etc
Create shades: Users will be able to create new paint colors. These will appear in the user's profile.
Rating reviews: A star rating feature with accompanying review posts.
Buying and shipping of product: This would include an Add to Cart/Buy now option and also a shipment tracking system.
